I built you a single-file Vanilla JS app that:

lets you enter any heights array (e.g., [0,4,0,0,0,6,0,6,4,0]),

computes trapped water in O(n) using the two-pointer method,

and renders a clean grid with blocks (yellow) and water (blue) on a responsive canvas, plus an optional fill animation.

It’s in the canvas to the right—save it as index.html and open in your browser.
Use Randomize to generate sample terrains, Compute to recalc, and Animate to watch the water fill.
